# HarmoVision

HarmoVision is a lightweight, high-performance CNN-Transformer hybrid model designed for efficient and accurate vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. By integrating novel attention mechanisms—Local Window Multi-Head Self-Attention (LW-MHSA), Channel-Spatial Global Attention (CGSA), Directional Spatial Attention (DSA), and Dynamic Channel Attention (DCA)—HarmoVision achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational complexity and parameter count. This repository contains the implementation of HarmoVision, along with scripts for training and evaluation on benchmark datasets like ImageNet, MS COCO, and ADE20K.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Architecture**: Combines CNN and Transformer strengths for balanced local and global feature extraction.
- **Attention Modules**:
  - **LW-MHSA**: Captures fine-grained local spatial dependencies with low computational overhead.
  - **CGSA**: Models global feature interactions and channel-wise importance using adaptive pooling and Swish activation.
  - **DSA & DCA**: Auxiliary modules that enhance spatial and channel attention, improving performance in downstream tasks.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Outperforms lightweight models like MobileViTv1 and EMO on ImageNet, MS COCO, and ADE20K, as shown in ablation studies.
- **Lightweight Design**: Optimized for single-GPU training (e.g., NVIDIA 4090) with minimal parameters and FLOPs.
- **Flexible Implementation**: Built using the CVNets framework, supporting easy integration and experimentation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- NVIDIA GPU (e.g., 4090) with CUDA support
- CVNets framework (see [CVNets GitHub](https://github.com/apple/ml-cvnets))
- Datasets: ImageNet, MS COCO, ADE20K (prepared according to CVNets guidelines)

python train.py --config configs/imagenet_harmovision_s.yaml --dataset imagenet --model harmovision_s

1. **Project Overview**: Provides a concise description of HarmoVision, emphasizing its purpose, key components, and performance highlights to attract interest from researchers and developers.

2. **Key Features**: Highlights the innovative aspects of HarmoVision (e.g., LW-MHSA, CGSA, DSA, DCA) and its performance advantages, drawing from the manuscript’s results.

3. **Installation**: Includes clear instructions for setting up the environment, leveraging the CVNets framework (referenced in your manuscript) and standard dependencies for PyTorch-based projects.

4. **Usage**: Provides example commands for training, evaluation, and ablation studies, assuming standard script names (`train.py`, `evaluate.py`, `ablation.py`) and a `configs/` directory, as these are typical for ML projects. You can update these if your repository uses different script names or structures.

5. **Experimental Results**: Summarizes key results from Tables \ref{tab7}–\ref{tab12} in a concise, reader-friendly format to showcase HarmoVision’s performance. Visualizations like figures are referenced but not included directly in the README, as is standard for GitHub.

6. **Project Structure**: Describes the assumed directory structure based on typical ML project conventions. You should update this section to match the actual structure of your repository.

7. **Contributing**: Follows GitHub conventions for encouraging contributions, with clear steps for forking, branching, and submitting pull requests.

8. **License and Citation**: Assumes an MIT License (common for open-source projects) and includes a BibTeX entry for citing your work, with a placeholder for the journal name (update as needed).

### Notes for Customization
- **Repository Structure**: Since I couldn’t access the actual repository content, I assumed a standard ML project structure (e.g., `configs/`, `models/`, `train.py`). Please update the **Project Structure** section and script names in the **Usage** section to match your actual repository.
- **Contact Information**: Replace `[your email or preferred contact method]` with your preferred contact details.
- **License**: I assumed an MIT License, but you should specify the actual license used in your repository.
- **Manuscript**: The README assumes the manuscript is included in a `docs/` directory. If it’s hosted elsewhere (e.g., arXiv), update the reference to point to the correct location.
- **Additional Details**: If your repository includes specific features (e.g., pretrained model weights, demo scripts, or visualizations), add these to the **Key Features** or **Usage** sections.

### Instructions for Adding the README
1. Create a file named `README.md` in the root of your repository (`HarmoVision/`).
2. Copy the above Markdown content into `README.md`.
3. Update placeholders (e.g., contact info, journal name, script names, directory structure) to reflect your project’s specifics.
4. Commit and push the file to your repository:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add README file"
   git push origin main
